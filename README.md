## Idea
Project design based on the 'lorum ipsem' project by John Smilga via freeCodeCamp.org. The CSS was straight-up stolen (tho modified slightly). 

## Data
Text taken from news articles about React.

## Tools

## Future Directions
1. Randomize text using lists of nouns/verbs/prepositions etc to build up pseudo-random nonsense sentences instead of blocks of sensible text.
