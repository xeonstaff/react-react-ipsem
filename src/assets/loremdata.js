    'If we talk about the modern front - end development technologies, React.js is absolutely killing it.The general perception is no language or framework is made to last forever, sooner or later a much more powerful alternative will make its entry.',
    'ReactJS is one of those JavaScript-based libraries used in web development and building interactive elements on the website. JavaScript is used to build and control dynamic website content like animated graphics, slideshows, photos, and interactive forms.',
    'And then all of a sudden a library called ‘React js’ comes to change the web landscape completely. Using SSR (Server-Side Rendering), now you can build web applications much faster and in an easier way than before. React changed the development landscape just like smartphones replace traditional phones.',
    'But that’s not a problem associated with ReactJS. Its declarative programming style enables programmers to express the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.',
    'If you are a front-end developer, you can learn ReactJS in little time. It’s easier to grasp for developers ( as all developers are familiar with JavaScript). The syntax is quite similar and the concepts are pretty much the same.',
    'In the IT sector, both ReactJS and Flutter are very popular worldwide. Flutter is created by Google and React by Facebook. The functioning of both is different from each other. Because ReactJS is a JavaScript library and Flutter is a framework. But there is one similarity between them: ReactJS and Flutter are both used for front-end development.',
    'In fact, React can be used to build single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks such as Next.js. But React is only concerned with handling state and rendering it to the DOM. Therefore, React applications usually require a particular client-side functionality as well as additional libraries for routing.',
    'In ReactJS, the numeric values, as well as expressions, must be written inside brackets{}. The “quotation marks” in JSX attributes represent strings. In most use cases, ReactJS is written using JSX unlike standard JavaScript to simplify components and keep the code clean. The ReactJS application generally has only a single root DOM node. It renders an element into the DOM and changes the UI of the page.',
    'The rule of thumb in React is to modify state via a setState function rather than mutate state directly. For example, our state is an array so rather than writing something like this.state.taks.push(insert new item here) our function will look a lot different and utilize setState.',
    'In this article, we are going to build a new React.js component, SubmitComponent, and add event functionality — to add text through the text bar. (We won’t discuss the JavaScript Event handlers themselves in depth so please check out this article instead if you’re curious.)',
    'This one is pretty standard and we did it in the last tutorial as well. In the submit component element in the return section on the App component, I defined a variable called handleChange = {this.handleChange}. Since the handleChange function isn’t in state, we don’t call it this.state.handle change but it will still be called as a prop in the submit component.',
    'However, there are some disadvantages to using ReactJS. One of the main disadvantages is that it can be difficult to learn. This is because it uses a different style of programming than most other languages. It can also be challenging to debug React JS applications due to the way that the code is written.',
    'Every time a change happens in a component, React compares the updated Virtual DOM with the pre-updated version of Virtual DOM to determine what changes were made to the components. React then reflects those changes to the real DOM.',
    'Several developments, designing, and debugging tools are available for fabricating React JS applications, and all these can be accessed freely over the internet. In addition, extensions of these tools are also available, leveraging developers to add tools to their Google Chrome and Firefox browsers flawlessly.',
    'For example, suppose you have to provide some additional features to your end-users when they buy the premium subscription for your application. For implementing it, the engineer has to create different components for each premium feature and configure them individually, making it a time-consuming task. However, with HOC implementation, React developers can create a Higher-Order component and put all the premium feature components inside it.',
    'As IoT technology makes its way into each industry, a strong framework is required to create such feature-rich apps. JavaScript has been a programming language used for web app development. Many JavaScript-based frameworks are readily available to create enterprise-grade and future-ready apps. However, of all such frameworks, React.js has been gaining a lot of attention lately in the developer community. The framework comes with several benefits, influencing developers to integrate React.js into IoT apps. Think of LinkedIn, PayPal, Netflix, and other such brands. These brands use React.js to develop apps and leverage the benefits listed below.',
    'React.js follows a descending stream of data flow. This happens from the parent components to the child components. Hence, any changes in the child components don’t affect parent components. Because of the downward data flow stream, when any changes are needed in the app, the developer just needs to alter its state and make changes. Only a few particular components of the app are refreshed. This helps with codebase stability and other benefits like enhancing code strength, improving app execution, and ensuring a smooth app performance.',
    'To do away with this issue, Facebook launched Virtual DOM in React.js, which is essentially a virtual portrayal of DOM. Changes are initially applied to Virtual DOM, which calculates and evaluates the risk related to each modification. The changes are then applied to the DOM as required without wasting much time. This makes server-side rendering faster and enhances app performance as not each component gets disturbed.',
    'React.js comes with a feature called JSX, a JavaScript grammar extension that helps make writing segments easy. It detects HTML citations as well as simplifies the representation of the subcomponents. React.js uses JSX to simplify the segment composition process for the developers. However, it is important to follow a few principles while composing on React.js to create clean and feature-rich apps. JSX assists in making custom IoT apps by preventing errors that might take place during the writing phase.',
    'Since there are two kinds of components now, you distinguish them by using server.js and client.js (and other related extensions like server.jsx and client.jsx) for server components and client components, respectively. Notice that client.js components are not something new. They are exactly like the React components you were already familiar with, only they now have a file extension so the engine knows which are which.'
